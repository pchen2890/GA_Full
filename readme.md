[Data Science Projects](./03-projects/)

Our Data Science Immersive includes seven weekly projects and one final "Capstone" project, subdivided into five deliverables. Each project builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

Projects include detailed objectives, requirements, and starter code, along with rubrics and solution code for student assessment. Each weekly project ties into the overall competencies developed during that week, while the capstone project requires students to apply and synthesize the skills developed within each unit.

#### [Weekly Projects](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly)

Weekly projects develop detailed scenarios for students, providing a context in which to apply the data science workflow to a specific dataset.

- [Project 1: SAT Scores + Summary Statistics](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-01)
- [Project 2: Billboard Hits + Data Munging](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-02)
- [Project 3: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-03)
- [Project 4: Web Scraping + Logistic Regression](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-04)
- [Project 5: Disaster Reflief + Classification](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-05)
- [Project 6: IMDB API + Random Forests](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-06)
- [Project 7: Airport Delays + Cluster Analysis](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-07)


#### [Capstone Projects](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone)

The Capstone project requires students to apply the data science workflow to their choice of dataset, in order to create detailed recommendations for an audience representative of their chosen industry. This project is sub-divided into five parts:

- [Part 1: Capstone Topic + Dataset Validation](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-01)
- [Part 2: Problem Statement + Exploratory Data Analysis](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-02)
- [Part 3: Progress Report + Preliminary Findings](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-03)
- [Part 4: Report Writeup + Technical Analysis](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-04)
- [Part 5: Presentation + Recommendations](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-05)
