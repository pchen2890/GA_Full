<a name="Control Flow and Python Review"></a>
## Introduction and Review (10 mins)

Over the last few days we've gone over quite a bit of python.

- Integers, floats, strings
- Arithmetic operators, string operators
- Variable assignment
- Lists and dictionaries, operations on both
- If, if/else, loops, functions
- Iteration, libraries

There are 9 exercises in iPython notebooks within the starter-code folder to help you review and challenge your python coding abilities. They vary in difficulty. Hard problems are identified in the header.

## Independent Practice: Topic (30 mins)

Pair up into groups of two to tackle one of the exercises. If you complete your assigned exercise, trying completing another one (or at least getting started on it).

On Tuesday, do exercises 1 and 2
On Wednesday, do exercise 3
On Thursday, do exercises 4 and 5
