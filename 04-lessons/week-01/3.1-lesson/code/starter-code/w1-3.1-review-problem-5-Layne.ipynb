    "### Review problem 5 (hard)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will be defining a function that calculates the **pearson correlation coefficient** between two lists of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept two arguments that are the provided lists ```X``` and ```Y```.\n",
    "- Print the length of ```X``` and ```Y``` using the ```len()``` function, like so:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    Length of X: 40\n",
    "    Length of Y: 40\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Calculate the **pearson correlation** between the two lists and assign the value to variable ```pearson_r```.\n",
    "    - Create a variable ```X_deviation``` that is each element of ```X``` minus the **mean** of ```X```. You can use ```np.mean()``` to calculate the mean.\n",
    "    - Create a variable ```Y_deviation``` that is each element of ```Y``` minus the **mean** of ```Y```.\n",
    "    - Create a variable ```sqrt_X_deviation_sq``` that is the **square root** of the **sum** of the **square** of each element of ```X_deviation```. Ive partially completed it below, for clarification:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        sqrt_X_deviation_sq = np.sqrt(np.sum(\"each element of X_deviation squared\"))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Create a variable ```sqrt_Y_deviation_sq``` that is the same thing you just did for ```X_deviation``` but for ```Y_deviation```.\n",
    "    - Create a variable ```sum_XY_deviation``` that is the **sum** of each element of X and Y multiplied by each other, in order. You can use the ```zip()``` function to iterate through two lists at the same time:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        for x_d, y_d in zip(X_deviation, Y_deviation):\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - ```pearson_r``` is equal to ```sum_XY_deviation``` divided by ```(sqrt_X_deviation_sq * sqrt_Y_deviation_sq)```\n",
    "- Print ```pearson_r```\n",
    "- Check if it is the same as numpys correlation function. Print ```np.corrcoef(X, Y)[0,1]```\n",
    "    "
